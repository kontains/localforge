1. SNAKE ARENA
PROMPT:
Create a browser Snake game in this folder (working directory), using Node.js + TypeScript and clean multi‑file structure: two AI‑controlled snakes battle on a 50×50 pastel grid, kawai vibe, glows, fading tails, food eating particle effects. each snake needs to seek random food, avoid walls and each other, respawn small after death, and reset the board while keeping cumulative scores. Scoring: +1 per second alive, +10 per food eaten, +50 when the rival dies and this snake survives, −10 on death. Implement smart path‑finding AI, silently consult experts as needed, and reply only after the entire, fully‑tested game is finished. Before starting fully discuss this task with an Expert so it can help you craft a detailed high level task-list and the architecture, after, start implementing. Let expert know that your goal is to keep things simple, and you are tight on time.
Expected Result: Completed one shot under 2$ (best result $1.6)
